Exercises from "Sams Teach Yourself Java in 24 Hours" by Rogers Cadenhead

Practice classes during my early exploration of Java.

once in my head. This is both to reduce typing reqirements and to develop
in classes similar to how most Java programs are written instead of the 
structured way the book uses.
